   Lab 4: ETL from one S3 bucket to another S3 bucket
 ========================================================

   1. Load the required data to S3
	1.1 Create the following S3 directory structure  (with your own bucket names, ofcourse)
		s3://iquiz.glue/movie_ratings/movies/             
		s3://iquiz.glue/movie_ratings/ratings/
		s3://iquiz.glue/movie_ratings/joined_output/

	1.2 Load the following datasets to the corresponding buckets:
		movies.csv to s3://iquiz.glue/movie_ratings/movies/
		ratings.csv to s3://iquiz.glue/movie_ratings/ratings/

   2. Create an IAM Role (CTSGlueRole) for Glue with the following policies:			
	Service: Glue
	Policies:   
	  -> AmazonS3FullAccess
	  -> AWSGlueServiceRole

   3. Create a database with the name 'glue_joins'

   4. Create two different crawlers to crawl the 'movies' and 'ratings' S3 buckets
      and run them. Use 'glue_joins' as database. (do not give any table prefixes)

	  -> After this step you should have 'movies' and ratings' tables created in Glue catalog

   5. Validate the data of 'movies' and 'ratings' using Athena. 
	

   6. Create the Glue job

	Create job
		Type: Spark script editor
		Options: 
			Upload and edit an existing script
			-> Browse and select the provide script file (moviesratings-join.py)

			** NOTE: make sure the following lines are modified **
			------------------------------------------------------
			glue_db = "glue_joins"
			glue_movies = "movies"
			glue_ratings = "ratings"

			s3_write_path = "s3://iquiz.glue/movie_ratings/joined_output/"
			----------------------------------------------------------------------

		Click on 'Create' button

	Click on 'Job details' tab
		Name: PySpark Joins Demo
		IAM Role: CTSGlueRole
		Requested number of workers: 2
		Generate job insights: uncheck
		Job timeout (minutes): 30
	Click on 'Save' button

   7. Run the job
	Wait until job is completed. 

   8. Check the results
	    Once the the job is complete the results of the script are stored in output s3 folder
	    -> Output s3 folder: s3://iquiz.glue/movie_ratings/joined_output/
