 Lab 3: Create a 'Workflow' to automate execution of triggers
===============================================================

 *** NOTE: This is a continuation of Lab 2 ***

 In this demo, we do the following:

   -> Create a Gluw Workflow and define the workflow pipeline
   -> Run the workflow
   -> Monitor the workflow for the status
   -> Validate results using Athena

   Source Data (Public S3 Bucket):  s3://crawler-public-us-east-1/flight/2016/csv


 Create a 'Workflow' to automate all the above steps
 ----------------------------------------------------

  Workflow is an archestrated pipeline that runs triggers. 
  Each trigger may invoke a crawler or run a job.

   1. Select 'Workflow' menu option from the AWS Glue console.

   2. Click on 'Add workflow' button
	Workflow name: Flights CSV to Parquet Workflow
        -> Add Workflow
	
   3. Define the workflow pipeline
	3.1 Select the workflow and click on 'Add trigger' button
	
	3.2 Add a new Trigger to Crawl the CSV data
		3.2.1 Click on 'Add new' tab
		      Name: Run glue crawler for flights CSV trigger
			  -> Add
		
	    3.2.2 Select the trigger from the graph and select 'Edit' option from 'Actions' dropdown
		      Trigger type: 'On demand'
		      -> Save
		
	3.3 Add a Crawler to this trigger	
		3.3.1 Select the trigger from the graph 
		3.3.2 Select 'Add jobs/crawlers to the trigger' option from 'Actions' dropdown
		3.3.3 Open 'Crawlers' tab
		3.3.4 Select 'FlightsDataCrawlerCSV'
		-> Add
	
	3.4 Add another trigger to the crawler we just added (to run the job)
		3.4.1 Select the crawler from the graph and click on 'Add trigger' option (on the graph)
		
		3.4.2 Select 'Add new' tab
			Name: Run flights_csv_to_parquet Job
			Trigger type: event
			Trigger logic: Start after ALL watched event
			-> Add
			
	3.5 Add a Job to the trigger
		3.5.1 Select the trigger (created in 3.4) from the graph	
		3.5.2 Select 'Add jobs/crawlers to the trigger' option from 'Actions' dropdown
		3.5.3 Open 'Jobs' tab
		3.5.4 Select 'flights_csv_to_parquet'
		-> Add
		
	3.6 Add another trigger to the job we just added (to run another crawler on parquet data)
		3.6.1 Select the job from the graph and click on 'Add trigger' option (on the graph)
		
		3.6.2 Select 'Add new' tab
			Name: Run glue crawler for flights PARQUET trigger
			Trigger type: event
			Trigger logic: Start after ALL watched event
			-> Add
			
	3.7 Add a Crawler to this trigger	
		3.7.1 Select the trigger from the graph 
		3.7.2 Select 'Add jobs/crawlers to the trigger' option from 'Actions' dropdown
		3.7.3 Open 'Crawlers' tab
		3.7.4 Select 'Flights Data Crawler Parquet'
		-> Add
		
   4.  Cleanup the data before running the workflow.
	4.1 Delete both the tables (flights_csv & flights_parquet) from the database
	4.2 Delete the 'parquet' folder in your S3 bucket 'cts-flights'
		
   5. Run the workflow
	5.1 Select the workflow you just created from the Glue console
	5.2 Select the very first trigger (on-demand trigger) (if it is not already selected) from the pipeline graph
	5.3 Click on 'Run workflow' button
	    => This step starts the workflow.
			
   6. Monitor the workflow for the status
	6.1 Select the workflow (in the running state)
	6.2 Click on 'History' tab
	6.3 Select the 'Run Id' of the workflow and click on 'View run details' button
	Here you can monitor the status of each trigger in the workflow. 
	This might take several minutes to process all the triggers. 
	
   7. Check the status after the workflow is completed
	7.1 Check for the two tables being created in the database (created by crawlers)
	7.2 Check the 'parquet' folder being created in S3 bucket (created by the job)
	
   8. Validate the data by running queries using Athena
	** Follow the steps from Lab-2 **
